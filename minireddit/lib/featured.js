  selftext_html: "&lt;p&gt;First of all, I had a lot of fun with this; it worked out to be a nice little weekend project. I'll probably keep using it to browse Reddit in the future, even :) So, thanks for the opportunity!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Design manifesto: I'm a UX designer as well as a front-end programmer, so my goal with this redesign was mainly to mock up improvements for what I saw as weaknesses with the current Reddit design, rather than invent a bunch of features to suit my own needs (however tempting that was). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Changes: &lt;br/&gt;Login form is sticky and more visible, logging in after voting on a link doesn't redirect you from the home page (I hate that; both because my intent usually isn't to go to the comments page after voting, and because there's no indication of whether my vote got counted after it happens).&lt;br/&gt;Moving around link information so it scans more easily, especially the subreddit names.&lt;br/&gt;Infinite scroll (Ok, so that was maybe driven by selfish motivations. Now I can have INFINITE REDDIT!)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stuff you can do: &lt;br/&gt;Filter by any subreddit or category tag.&lt;br/&gt;Save and hide links.&lt;br/&gt;Expand embedded videos and self-text. Login is only pretend, but you can have fun with persistent up-and-downvotes.&lt;/p&gt;",
